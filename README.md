# Algorithmic Chocolate Cake

##Ingredients

* 256 g flour

* 175 g unsalted butter, melted

* 32 g cocoa powder

* 210 g sugar

* 3 eggs

* 81 ml milk

* 2 tsp baking powder

* 5 g vanilla sugar

* 1 pinch salt

-------------------------------------

##Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven and your brain. For the **first digit**, take the butter’s grams, write it in binary, and count the number of 1-bits (the popcount).

2. Beat the eggs until “fully permuted.” Take the factorial of the number of eggs and whisk them in as the **second digit**.

3. Fold in the sugar without clumping. The **third digit** is the number of distinct prime factors of the sugar's grams.

4. Whisk milk into the batter of thought. For **digit four**, from the milk’s milliliters, sum its decimal digits, then take the integer square root of that sum.

Add the other dry ingredients without leaving a mathematical trace, pour into a lined tin, and bake until a toothpick comes out clean. While it bakes, assemble the four digits in order to open your lock.
