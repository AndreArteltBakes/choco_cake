# Algorithmic Chocolate Cake

## Ingredients

* 256 g flour

* 175 g unsalted butter, melted

* 32 g cocoa powder

* 210 g sugar

* 3 eggs

* 81 ml milk

* 2 tsp (10 g) baking powder

* 5 g vanilla sugar

* 1 pinch (3 g) salt

-------------------------------------

## Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven and your brain. For the **first digit**, take the butter’s grams, write it in binary, and count the number of 1-bits (the popcount).

2. Beat the eggs until “fully permuted.” Take the factorial of the number of eggs and whisk them in as the **second digit**.

3. Fold in the sugar without clumping. The **third digit** is the number of distinct prime factors of the sugar's grams.

4. Whisk milk into the batter of thought. For **digit four**, from the milk’s milliliters, sum its decimal digits, then take the integer square root of that sum.

Add the total mass of the other dry ingredients to your code, pour into a lined tin, and bake until a toothpick comes out clean. While it bakes, assemble the four digits in order to open your lock.
